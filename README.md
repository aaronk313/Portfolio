# Portfolio

My portfolio of exercises in learning Data Science. This portfolio will be updated on a rolling basis as new techniques and concepts are being explored.

- Project 1: SAT Scores
- Project 2: Lucid Titanic Sleuthing
- Project 3: Liquor Sales + Linear Regression
- Project 4: Web Scraping + Logistic Regression (Under Revision)
- Project 5: Titanic Revisited - Remote DB
- Project 6: IMDB API + Random Forests
- Project 7: Airport Delays + Cluster Analysis

During my experience at General Assembly, I learned and demonstrated skill sets in Data Science methodologies in practical real world scenarios. The logic behind some of the approaches taken to the solutions are explained in the respective ReadMe which we were required to follow. 

Skills Demonstrated: 
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Web Scraping, Scikit Learn, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, Regex, Linear & Logistic Regression modeling, Random Forests, kNN, NLP, Technical Writing, Object Oriented Programing (OOP)

# Project Learning Sentry (In Progress)

Using a combination of kNN/kMeans clustering and Logistic Regression modeling, I attempted to build a security model in which a system could be secured by the learned behavior of its' user. 

The ultimate objective of this project is to change the paradigm of the currently understood user/password model of authentication and to improve security by authenticating based on the users' pattern of behavior as opposed to a password or other static token.

This project is still in progress and will be posted once an inital working model can be demonstrated.
